# Real Estate Anomaly Detector

This repository hosts our CS4824 Capstone Project, which aims to develop an end-to-end machine learning model that detects anomalous pricing in the housing market. In this context, housing market anomalies refer to listings that deviate from expected market behavior, typically driven by supply, demand, and broader economic fundamentals. Anomalies challenge the idea that markets are perfectly efficient; they may arise intentionally, as scams and unassured pricing, or unintentionally through human error or flawed valuation models. Establishing a reliable way to identify these irregularities can help minimize losses for both sellers and buyers.
